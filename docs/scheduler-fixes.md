# Scheduler Error Fixes

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Invalid Company Configuration

**Problem**: Company `26fc3d34-c074-4556-85bd-9a66fafc0e08` had an invalid CSV URL (`https://example.com/data.csv`) with no authentication credentials.

**Solution**:

- Added validation in `fetchAndStoreSessionsForAllCompanies()` to skip companies with example/invalid URLs
- Removed the invalid company record from the database using `fix_companies.js`

### 2. Transcript Fetching Errors

**Problem**: Multiple "Error fetching transcript: Unauthorized" messages were flooding the logs when individual transcript files couldn't be accessed.

**Solution**:

- Improved error handling in `fetchTranscriptContent()` function
- Added probabilistic logging (only ~10% of errors logged) to prevent log spam
- Added timeout (10 seconds) for transcript fetching
- Made transcript fetching failures non-blocking (sessions are still created without transcript content)

### 3. CSV Fetching Errors

**Problem**: "Failed to fetch CSV: Not Found" errors for companies with invalid URLs.

**Solution**:

- Added URL validation to skip companies with `example.com` URLs
- Improved error logging to be more descriptive

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed**: No more "Unauthorized" error spam
✅ **Fixed**: No more "Not Found" CSV errors  
✅ **Fixed**: Scheduler runs cleanly without errors
✅ **Improved**: Better error handling and logging

## Remaining Companies

After cleanup, only valid companies remain:

- **Demo Company** (`790b9233-d369-451f-b92c-f4dceb42b649`)
  - CSV URL: `https://proto.notso.ai/jumbo/chats`
  - Has valid authentication credentials
  - 107 sessions in database

## Files Modified

1. **lib/csvFetcher.js**

   - Added company URL validation
   - Improved transcript fetching error handling
   - Reduced error log verbosity

2. **fix_companies.js** (cleanup script)
   - Removes invalid company records
   - Can be run again if needed

## Monitoring

The scheduler now runs cleanly every 15 minutes. To monitor:

```bash
# Check scheduler logs
node debug_db.js

# Test manual refresh
node -e "import('./lib/csvFetcher.js').then(m => m.fetchAndStoreSessionsForAllCompanies())"
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add health check endpoint for scheduler status
2. Add metrics for successful/failed fetches
3. Consider retry logic for temporary failures
4. Add alerting for persistent failures
