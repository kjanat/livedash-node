# TODO - Remaining Improvement Items

## High Priority

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage for API endpoints (currently minimal)
- [ ] Implement integration tests for the data processing pipeline
- [ ] Add unit tests for validation schemas and authentication logic
- [ ] Create E2E tests for critical user flows (registration, login, dashboard)

### Error Handling & Monitoring
- [ ] Implement global error boundaries for React components
- [ ] Add structured logging with correlation IDs for request tracing
- [ ] Set up error monitoring and alerting (e.g., Sentry integration)
- [ ] Add proper error pages for 404, 500, and other HTTP status codes

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement database query optimization and indexing strategy
- [ ] Add caching layer for frequently accessed data (Redis/in-memory)
- [ ] Optimize React components with proper memoization
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for dashboard components and charts

## Medium Priority

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Add CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- [ ] Implement session timeout and refresh token mechanism
- [ ] Add API rate limiting with Redis-backed storage (replace in-memory)
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- [ ] Add audit logging for sensitive operations

### Code Quality & Maintenance
- [ ] Resolve remaining ESLint warnings and type issues
- [ ] Standardize chart library usage (currently mixing Chart.js and other libraries)
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript strict mode configuration
- [ ] Implement consistent API response formats across all endpoints

### Database & Schema
- [ ] Add database connection pooling configuration
- [ ] Implement proper database migrations for production deployment
- [ ] Add data retention policies for session data
- [ ] Consider database partitioning for large-scale data

### User Experience
- [ ] Add loading states and skeleton components throughout the application
- [ ] Implement proper form validation feedback and error messages
- [ ] Add pagination for large data sets in dashboard tables
- [ ] Implement real-time notifications for processing status updates

## Low Priority

### Documentation & Development
- [ ] Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Create deployment guides for different environments
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines and code review checklist
- [ ] Implement development environment setup automation

### Feature Enhancements
- [ ] Add data export functionality (CSV, PDF reports)
- [ ] Implement dashboard customization and user preferences
- [ ] Add multi-language support (i18n)
- [ ] Create admin panel for system configuration

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- [ ] Add Docker configuration for containerized deployment
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- [ ] Add environment-specific configuration management
- [ ] Set up monitoring and health check endpoints

### Analytics & Insights
- [ ] Add more detailed analytics and reporting features
- [ ] Implement A/B testing framework for UI improvements
- [ ] Add user behavior tracking and analytics
- [ ] Create automated report generation and scheduling

## Completed âœ…
- [x] Fix duplicate MetricCard components
- [x] Add input validation schema with Zod
- [x] Strengthen password requirements (12+ chars, complexity)
- [x] Fix schema drift - create missing migrations
- [x] Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints
- [x] Update README.md to use pnpm instead of npm

## Notes
- Focus on high-priority items first, especially testing and error handling
- Security enhancements should be implemented before production deployment
- Performance optimizations can be added incrementally based on usage metrics
- Consider user feedback when prioritizing feature enhancements
